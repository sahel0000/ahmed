    <h3>1.Introduction:</h3>
 <p>   Now a days, one of the main threats that It  system and security environment can have, is the possibility of intruders in the system. an intruder can attack systems based on identification card or token by robbing, copying or simulating them .This is normally solved by identifying or verifying the person with some technique(1) . Therefore, public and private operational bodies highly recommend the use of biometrics to improve traditional security systems(2) . As it is a well-known, biometric deal with identification of individuals based on their physical and behavioral features.The term of identity is defined as the quality or condition of being the same in substance, composition, nature, properties, or in particularqualities under consideration . Three approaches are available to prove a person‘s identity and to provide the right person with the right privileges, the right access at the right time. These identity proving approaches, which establish the genuineness of the identity, are:  Something you have The associated service or access is received through the presentation of a physical object (keys, magnetic card, identity document etc.) in possession of the concerned person.  Something you know A predefined knowledge, as a password normally kept secret,  permits to access a service. Something you are Measurable personal traits, such as biometric measures, can also be used proveFor identity  A combination of these approaches makes the identity proof more secure. In day to day  activities, the combination of possession and knowledge is very widespread. The use of  the third approach, in addition to the others, has significant advantages. Without  sophisticated means, biometrics is difficult to share, steal or forge and cannot be  forgotten or lost(3) .There is currently considerable interest and activity associated with the use of biometrics in many  different areas such as banking, education and other public services as well as in the travel security context. Further, biometric-based technologies hold the opportunity to identify individuals in remote network  environments and through varied modalities of communications. Also, the biometric industry has  experienced substantial growth in the recent past and is expected to experience even more growth in the  next five years. A number of biometric standards have been or are being developed to support the industry  and the technology.  The world of biometric-based technologies brings with it new terms and concepts, an understanding  of which is important to an informed discussion of the subject matter. The report introduces the following  major biometric-based technologies: finger-scanning, hand geometry, facial recognition, iris scanning,  retinal scanning, finger geometry, voice recognition and dynamic signature verification.  keystroke dynamics and gait recognition is also provided. DNA-based technology, which is not strictly a  biometric, but raises many of the same concerns as biometrics, is addressed in Annex III.  All biometric systems operate in essentially the same manner. They capture a biometric sample,  perform feature extraction or dataset creation and perform one of two types of searches. They provide  either a one-to-one (1:1) or a one-to-many (1:N) search capability. As regards the biometric system  performance,  . Among the metrics discussed are: false reject rate, false acceptance rate, equal error rate ,and   applications of biometric  (4)</p>
    <h2>2.Definition:</h2> 
    <p>Biometric is science of measurement and analysis the physical and the  behaviour of  a character such as DNA ,voice patterns ,facial patterns and hand measurement  for authentication purposes ,Each of these identifiers is considered unique to the individual, and they may be used in combination to ensure greater accuracy of identification.(5)</p>
    <h2>3.The biometric history:</h2>
    <p>biometric is becoming an interesting to pick now regards security but the ideas of biometric have been around for many years, In a cave estimated to be at least 31,000 years old, the walls are adorned with paintings  believed to be created by prehistoric men who lived there. Surrounding these painting are  numerous hand-prints like their unique signature. There is also evidence that fingerprints were used as a person‘s mark as early as 500 B.C. in Babylon.[1] Joao D. Barros wrote that early Chinese merchant used fingerprint to settle transactions. By the mid-1800s, due to industry revolution and growth, there was a need to indentify people. With the influence of writings of Jeremy Betham and other Utilitarian thinkers, the courts of this time period began to codify concepts of justice that endure with us to this day. This created a need for formal system for identification with the use of identity traits. There were two approaches introduced in this duration. The first approach was the Bertillon system of measuring various body dimensions, which was originated in France. The other approach was the formal use of fingerprints by police departments. This method was used in South America, Asia and Europe. By the late 1800s a method was developed to index fingerprints that provided the ability to retrieve records. The first robust system for indexing fingerprints was developed in India by Aziz Hague for Edward Henry, IGP of Bengal, India. This system was called the Henry System. The biometric systems began to emerge in the latter half of the 20th century, coinciding with the emergence of computer systems. The emerging field experienced an explosion of activity in the 1990s and began to surface in everyday applications in 2000s(6)</p>
    <h2>4.Type of biometric:</h2>
    <p>When most people think of biometric ,they imagine fingerprint or facial recognition but there are many different types of biometrics used today to identify and authenticate individuals .whether for security ,access ,or fraud prevention, biometrics come in many forms and the software needed to collect biometric data is evolving quickly, as well There are 14 different types of biometric ,such as Physiological Biometrics and Behavioral Biometrics(7).                                           </p>
